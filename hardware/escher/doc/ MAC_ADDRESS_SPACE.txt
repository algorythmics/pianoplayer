MAC-ADDRESSES for ESCHER DSP.


MAC-Addresses have to be assigned by programming with tcp/ip stack or other 
software using the ethernet port on ESCHER DSP board.

Since they have to be unique and we have no vendor tag we choose
localy assigned addresses with the schema below.

(see mac_address_tutorial_ieee.pdf for discussion on these issue).

Since our board get a handwritten Serie-Number, we use these as distinguisher:

Locally managed MAC addresses with individuell target means second least significant bit to be set
and least significant bit to be 0 on the most significant Byte.

Algorytmics choOses: 

  HEX: 02-00-00-nn-nn-nn
where nn-nn-nn is the serial number in HEX.

(Note first prototype board was 00, second burned one 01)

eg. 
  First board of Serie 1:  02-00-00-00-00-01  (15 are produced)
  We asume not more then 65535 are produced on one serie ;-)))


Serie		| Number of boards	| Range
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prototype	|                2	| 02-00-00-00-00-01 .. 02-00-00-00-00-02
Serie One	|		15	| 02-00-00-01-00-01 .. 02-00-00-01-00-0F
Serie Two	| to be done ....

If you produce a serie please let me know an write serial number on it
