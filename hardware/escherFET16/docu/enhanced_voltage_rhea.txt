Tests f√ºr enhanced voltage
--------------------------

For rhea player to get maximum velocity on some pianos a harder stroke is needed.
Therefore the FET16 must be expanded from 30V maximum to 48V or more.

One idea is to exchange the FET on the board. Note also the condensors with a lower Volatage limit has to be choosen.

           max Volatage    max ID cont  max ID pulsed
RSR030N06   60V             3A           16A
RTR040N03   30V             4A           16A

Notes tested for maximum hearable velocity and attack-times:
